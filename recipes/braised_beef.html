    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An elevated version of homestyle pot roast, this braised beef is hearty and full<br>
        of earthy richness. It would pair well with mashed potatoes, buttery noodles, or crusty bread.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ pounds boneless beef chuck roast</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound cremini mushrooms, halved</li>
        <li>3 medium carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, cut in half lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>
        <li>3 sprigs thyme</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h2>Steps</h2><br>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Season beef pieces evenly on all sides with 3 1/2 teaspoons salt, 2 teaspoons<br>
             pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add beef, reduce heat to medium high<br>
            and cook, undisturbed until it releases easily from the skillet and a golden brown<br>
            crust has formed, about 4 minutes. Flip pieces and continue to cook until browned on<br>
            all sides. Remove meat from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Return skillet to medium-high heat and add 2 tablespoons butter to the drippings in<br>
            the pan. When butter has melted add onion, mushrooms and carrots and cook 5 minutes,<br>
            stirring often, scraping to release any browned bits from the bottom. Add garlic and<br>
            cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Stir in wine and scrape to release any more bits from the pan. Return the meat to the<br>
            pan, along with any accumulated juices and add thyme, bay leaves and Worcestershire.</li>
        <li>Pour in beef broth just enough that it comes up 2/3 of the way up on the beef (do not<br>
            fully submerge the meat in liquid). Bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Cover and place in preheated oven until meat is very tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
