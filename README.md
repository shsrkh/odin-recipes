# Purpose
In this project, I demonstrated the basic HTML skills that I acquired in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) (a free open source coding curriculum). 

## Project
A simple HTML-only website with recipes for a couple of dishes.

## Practiced HTML basics
Working with html tags like header, image, paragraph, link, unordered and ordered lists.
